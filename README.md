###👾 FLYING ALIENS 👾
### This is a remake of Nguyen Ha Dong's Flappy Bird in 2013 🐦
This is my UET Game Coding Assignment 🎮 Using Codeblocks C++ and SDL2 🧑🏻‍💻

###🗣️ INTRODUCTION 🗣️
My Code use the SDL2 library as the main tool to develop, with the help of my senior Hoang Duc Duong I've finished my game with the whole new look. The graphics are drawn by myself using pixilart.com 100%. In this game you will be a little alien in the large space, flying to explore this whole mysterious space, trying not to collide with the rockets all around the space. This is not only a game to entertain, but also can help you to learn how to focus not to stop the alien's adventure.

###🎮 QUICK GAMEPLAY 🎮
The gameplay are quite easy to use. I also add some more actions you can make while playing game:
- Press <b>SPACE</b> or <b>UP</b> or <b>CLICK</b> to make the alien fly
- You can press <b>P</b> to pause the game if you want to

- You will get one point if your alien can flying through the obstacles. Try your best to gain the best score 🥰
- If your alien collides with the rockets, they will fall down and the game is over. The journey is started again if you want to replay.

###🤌🏻 FEATURES 🤌🏻
- You can pause the game while playing
- You can choose between two aliens <b>RED</b> or <b>BLUE</b>
- Funny music and sound while playing, match with the space theme
- You can turn on and off the music and sound to not distract you from the gameplay
